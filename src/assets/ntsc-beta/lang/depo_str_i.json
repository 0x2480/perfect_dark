Softly, softly, Joanna.\n\n|Objective One: - Disable Damping Field Generator\n\nA device in the car garage section of the building is preventing the transmission of any information recorded by the cam spy. Once shut down, the cam spy can relay any captured recordings back to HQ.\n\n|Objective Two: - Deactivate Laser Grid Systems\n\nAn examination of the power grid of the G5 Building indicates a network of laser grids. These grids are placed specifically to deny a route into the meeting room, but if you can turn them off, the way is clear.\n\n|Objective Three: - Holograph Meeting Conspirators\n\nThe CamSpy device is an excellent way to record the meeting without alerting De Vries and the other conspirators.\n\n|Objective Four: - Retrieve Backup From Safe\n\nDr. Caroll informed Daniel of a backup personality that is stored in a safe in the G5 Building. If we can obtain it, it would mean that we could restore the personality to Dr. Caroll at a later date.\n\n|Objective Five: - Exit Building\n\nDestroy the blocked-up door to create your exit. If you remember which level of the fire escape is outside, you may save yourself some time.\n\nEND\n"
