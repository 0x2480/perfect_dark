Locate it and shut it down.\n\n|Objective Two: - De-activate Laser Grid Systems\n\nAn examination of the power grid of the G5 building indicates a network of laser grids. These grids are placed specifically to deny a route into the meeting room, but if you can turn them off, the way is clear.\n\n|Objective Three: - Record Meeting\n\nThe Eye-Spy device is an excellent way to record the meeting without alerting the De Vries and the other conspirators.\n\n|Objective Four: - Retrieve Backup From Safe\n\nDr. Caroll informed Daniel of a backup personality that is stored in a safe in the G5 building. If we can obtain it it would mean that we could restore the personality to Dr. Caroll at a later date.\n\n|Objective Five: - Exit Building\n\nDestroy the blocked-up door to create your exit.
