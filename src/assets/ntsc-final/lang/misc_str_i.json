It was equipped with an untried weapon - the weak nuclear force de-coupler, which could in theory cause the bonds which held molecules together to fail. So that watching eyes would believe in the destruction of the ship, a message pod was sent back to the home system, and vital parts of the drive systems were destroyed in the star system they had chosen to hide in.\n\nMaian aliens encounter life on Earth. They see potential, but decide to leave the primitive race of humans alone to develop.\n\nThe Maians meet the Skedar, and they have a fight that turns into a protracted war. After hundreds of years of fighting, an uneasy peace develops. Fanatical Skedar continually test the boundaries of this peace with terrorist activities, but the Maians refuse to be drawn.\n\nThe Maians are wary of humans, sensing that too many crises have arisen on Earth as a result of technology and 'outside context situations.' They fear that announcing their presence may well precipitate further wars on the planet and therefore decide to observe the race until it becomes more mature.\n\nDaniel Carrington jumps the gun by contacting a Maian ship in orbit above Earth. He has a plan that would help both parties, resulting in accelerated contact between humans and Maians. Having agreed that his plan is sound, and that he is a person of integrity, the Maians help Daniel Carrington to release their technology into the public domain.\n\nThe Skedar fanatics find a message pod from the Cetan battle cruiser. They immediately scout Earth in a particularly heavy-handed way, abducting people and mutilating animals in an attempt to find out where the battle cruiser is. Their tests direct them to the Pacific Ocean where they locate the ship. However, they need help to get to it.\n\nThey perform their own study of Earth and come up with a shortlist of companies with the resources to help them recover the sunken ship. At the top of the list is the dataDyne Corporation. They contact the head of the corporation, Cassandra De Vries, and present her with a deal that sounds too good to be true - which it is. They say that in return for helping the Skedar raise 'their' ship from the ocean floor, they will give dataDyne enough technology to become the biggest corporation on the planet. All that dataDyne has to do is build an AI unit with language and code-breaking abilities.  This is tricky, but within their means. Work commences on the project.\n\nCassandra De Vries approaches the head of the NSA, Trent Easton, with the details. He attempts to get Presidential approval for the loan of a deep-sea research vessel to dataDyne but is refused by the President.  There is no way that the Skedar or dataDyne could steal the vessel without triggering the wrath of the U.S. government, so they settle on a plan of replacing the President with a clone that they can control. This promises to have extra rewards for Trent and Cassandra after the Skedar operation is finished.\n\nHowever, they will not have an awful lot of time to gloat. The Skedar plan to test the weak nuclear force de-coupler on Earth before wiping the Maians out of existence. Cassandra is blinded to the possibility of being double-crossed by the enormous gain in power she will have. This affliction also affects Trent Easton.\n\nBut dataDyne has made the one thing that can see such dangers emerge from the sea of facts around itself - the sapient AI created to crack the access codes of the Cetan battle cruiser. When it expresses concern about the mission it is being created for, the response of Cassandra De Vries is to order its personality removed. Clearly, it is thinking too much. In desperation, it contacts the Carrington organization with a plea for help, under the pseudonym Dr. Caroll...\n"

With the alarm raised, Joanna has to fight her way up the tower to get to the helipad for the extraction by dropship.\n\nIn response to this, dataDyne targets Daniel Carrington and takes him hostage two days later at his private villa. They demand the return of the AI - their 'property' - in exchange for Daniel Carrington's life. Unknown to them, the AI is at the villa. Carrington had been talking with it to find out about dataDyne's future plans. Joanna rescues Daniel but is unable to prevent dataDyne from recovering Dr. Caroll. However, her boss has heard enough from the AI to prompt him to summon a team of Maian specialists to Earth.\n\nJoanna is dispatched to Chicago to spy on a conspirators' meeting at the G5 Building, a front for the dataDyne Corp. She learns of the involvement of Trent Easton, the head of the NSA, and of the strange Nordic men that seem to be in control of the whole scheme. Once the plan to move on the President is disclosed by Trent, Jo calls in with the news but finds out there is another, more urgent, job for her to complete first.\n\nThe specialists have been intercepted by the conspirators, and the survivors of the crash and the crash wreckage itself have been taken to Area 51 in Nevada. Joanna is dropped in to link up with another Carrington Institute agent to rescue any survivors and to retrieve any of their equipment. When she breaks into the medlab, Joanna discovers the Carrington Institute's secret - their allies are Maians, the aliens known as Greys. The particular alien she rescues is called Elvis. He was a bodyguard for the Ambassador who was coming in as the head of the team of specialists.\n\nHaving aided the remnants of the Maian delegation, Joanna can turn to the matter of the President and dataDyne's designs against him. She poses as a member of the President's entourage to gain access to the air base where Air Force One is stationed and manages to conceal herself on board the airplane. Once it is in the air, Trent and the cloaked Skedar make their move - but Joanna is there to stop him. She gets the President to a safety capsule while a team of Trent's men scour the aircraft for him, intent on dragging the hapless politician aboard the Skedar UFO, now docked to AF1 via an umbilical. Jo weakens the umbilical but is unable to break it. She calls on Elvis, who decides to crash into it. All three craft go down in the Alaskan wilderness, and the escape pod is launched.\n\nJo wakes up and tries to report in but finds her communications being jammed by a transmission from the Skedar craft. She sets off through the snow to find the President and Elvis. She comes across teams of cloaked Skedar who are searching for her, the President, Elvis, and some of the President's belongings. She tracks one group back to the downed Skedar ship where she discovers a clone of the President. She destroys this and shuts down the jamming device, then calls in the cavalry. The Skedar have been thwarted again, the President is saved, and Trent is killed horribly by the Skedar for failing to be competent in the first place.\n\nThrowing caution to the wind, dataDyne and the Skedar steal the Government's deep-sea research vessel 'Pelagic II' and head out to the crash site. Joanna goes out with Elvis to disrupt activity on board the ship and to find out what the big project is. After crippling the diving operations on the ship and recalling the submersible, they head down to the ocean floor, where they get their first sight of the sunken Cetan battle cruiser. Entering the ship through the portal the Skedar have made, they come across a dead Skedar warrior... Clearly the assault team didn't have it all their own way. After fighting off the Skedar and avoiding the Cetans, Joanna and Elvis get to the core of the ship, where they find the AI that was once Dr. Caroll. Once his personality is restored, he urges Joanna and Elvis to leave the ship, which he intends to destroy for good.\n\nBack at the Carrington Institute, Joanna is about to leave for a Presidential reception at the White House when all hell breaks loose. The surviving Skedar assault team vent their anger on the people responsible for their failure to recover the Cetan ship. Joanna runs around the Institute trying to escort CI employees to the hangars while the Skedar attack different parts of the building. While the majority of the employees escape, Joanna holds the Skedar off before getting knocked unconscious and captured by them.\n\nShe wakes up in a holding cell on board the Skedar assault ship with Cassandra De Vries for company. The dataDyne CEO dies while creating a distraction for Joanna to break out. Jo manages to get through to lower the docking bay shields, and Elvis brings a few friends in for a shooting party.\n\nThe captured ship enters orbit above the Skedar Battle Shrine, which gives Elvis a shock since the Maians could never find this Skedar 'holiest of holy' places. If the Shrine were destroyed, the Skedar morale would be dealt a fatal blow and there would be true peace instead of an uneasy ceasefire. Jo sets her sights on the leader of the Skedar, the high priest of the Battle Shrine, while Elvis returns to the assault ship to summon the Maian fleet.\n\nThe game finishes with the temple in ruins... Elvis calls for a lull in the bombardment so that he can find Joanna. She is alive, held under a pile of rubble by a Skedar that grabbed her foot before she could get clear. Elvis lends her a gun to help convince the Skedar to let go, and they depart for orbit.\n"

After the third armament company was bought by dataDyne, profits became astronomical. Within a month of the receipt of a government contract for weapons development, Cassandra De Vries was CEO.
