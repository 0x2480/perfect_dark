Cassandra and dataDyne are going to be throwing all the obstacles they can in your path to prevent you from getting Dr. Caroll out. Good luck.\n\n|Objective One: - Gain Access to Upper Floors\n\nFight your way around the foyer until you can get access to one of the lifts that will take you and Dr. Caroll to the upper floors of the building.\n\n|Objective Two: - Reactivate Elevator\n\nWe traced an order to shut down the only accessible elevator to a PC on the lowest floor of offices. You have to find that PC and change the order to get the elevator going again.\n\n|Objective Three: - Destroy dataDyne Gunship\n\nThere is a dataDyne security gunship circling the building which outguns your jumpship and will shoot you out of the sky. Terminate it with extreme prejudice, since it will be trying to do the same thing to you.\n\n|Objective Four: - Defeat Cassandra's Bodyguards\n\nWe suspect that Cassandra has deployed her bodyguards to block the route to the helipad. It is almost certain that you'll be unable to avoid them, so expect serious resistance when you encounter them.\n\n|Objective Five: - Return to Helipad for Evacuation\n\nGet to the helipad where your dropship will be waiting. And don't forget Dr. Caroll.\n\nEND\n"
