The whereabouts of the President are uncertain, and a cloud of ECM jamming is preventing rescuers from finding the site of the crash.\n\n|Carrington - \n\nAt this moment in time, this one-way text messaging system is the only way we can communicate with you, Joanna. If you can remove the source of the jamming, then we can get a fix on your location and send help. But locating and ensuring the safety of the President should be your most important task.\n\n|Objective One: - Retrieve Presidential Medical Scanner\n\nThis device is constantly updating the President's medical history and is able to maintain a check on his state of health. You will need it if you are to ensure his well-being.\n\n|Objective Two: - Activate Distress Beacon\n\nIt won't do much good until the jamming is down, but if you activate the beacon in the escape pod, it will shorten the response time of the rescue teams.\n\n|Objective Three: - Shut Down Enemy Jamming Device\n\nA sophisticated jamming device is flooding the area with impenetrable ECM cover. You might be able to pinpoint the source on the ground more effectively than our high-altitude overflights are doing. Once located, shut the source down so we can fix your position and get help.\n\n|Objective Four: - Retire Presidential Clone\n\nIt would be detrimental to the security of the United States of America to have two identical people claiming to be the President, issuing orders with absolute authority. Identify the imposter and remove the threat.\n\n|Objective Five: - Locate and Rescue President\n\nThis is your highest priority. The safety of the President is paramount. You must find a way to safeguard him until help arrives or the danger is past.\n\nEND\n",
