	/*0x00*/ "|Background - \n\nIn revenge for the foiling of their grand plan, the Skedar have attacked the source of their troubles, the Carrington Institute. With an organised response out of the question, it falls to Joanna to save what she can of the Institute from total destruction.\n\n|Carrington - \n\nThey've caught us completely off guard, Jo! Save who and what you can then get out yourself. After all, the Institute is the people, not the building.\n\n|Objective One: - Reactivate Automatic Defences\n\nThere are automatic guns situated at strategic locations throughout the Carrington Institute. At present they are inactive, but if you can get to the control panel and activate them they will help thin the attackers out.\n\n|Objective Two: - Minimise Hostage Casualties\n\nSome of the invading forces are holding key Institute staff hostage. Save as many of the hostages as you can. Look in the various labs thoughout the upper floors of the building.\n\n|Objective Three: - Retrieve Experimental Weapon\n\nIn Foster's weapons lab there is a prototype submachinegun that we cannot let fall into enemy hands. This is because the weapon is capable of creating a temporary cloaking field. Find it and carry out some 'field research'.\n\n|Objective Four: - Destroy Sensitive Information\n\nIn Daniel's office there is a safe in which is kept the algorithm he used to crack the Maian communication codes so many years ago. It must be destroyed before dataDyne or the Skedar get hold of it. They could use it to wreak havoc on our allies.\n\n|Objective Five: - Deactivate Bomb\n\nOur sensors indicate there is a bomb somewhere in the building! It is unlikely to be a subtle device, so merely getting it out of the Institute won't help. It needs to be deactivated. \n\nEND\n",
