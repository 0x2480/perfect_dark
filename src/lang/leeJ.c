I'm following the Assault Ship that is holding you! With me are two Maian protectors from the delegation at the White House. If you can get us aboard we can help you take over the ship.\n\n|Objective One: - Disable Shield System\n\nThe shield system prevents any docking manoeuvres from taking place. Drop the shields so Elvis and his companions can start an approach.\n\n|Objective Two: - Open Hangar Doors\n\nThe docking system is normally controlled automatically - it must have been overridden from the bridge. Open the doors using the local controls overlooking the hangar and Elvis can finish the landing cycle.\n\n|Objective Three: - Access Navigational Systems\n\nGet Elvis to the Starmap so that he can find out where the Assault Ship is heading. There might also be the locations of Skedar strongholds within the Starmap - this information can be used for decisive strikes by the Maian Fleet.\n\n|Objective Four: - Sabotage Engine Systems\n\nThe plan to take over the Assault Ship might go awry if the Commander alters from the set course. Tamper with the engines so that the ship comes to a halt.\n\n|Objective Five: - Gain Control Of Bridge\n\nOnce the Bridge is taken, the ship is no longer under Skedar control. Only the Commander remains inside.\n\nEND\n",
