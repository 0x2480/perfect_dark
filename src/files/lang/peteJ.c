It will come in very useful if the situation hasn't changed since the recon team's report earlier. One more thing, Joanna - there's a security robot patrolling the street. Stay away from it if at all possible.\n\n|Objective One: - Retrieve Drop Point Equipment\n\nThe recon team we sent in while you were in transit left a small package of equipment for you, hidden in one of the storm drains. It has just about everything you will need to complete the mission objectives.\n\n|Objective Two: - Attach Tracer To Limousine\n\nThe limousine in the main street arrived not long before you did. All attempts at a trace have come up blank so it will have to be handled the old-fashioned way. Place a bug on the limo so it can be tracked back to where it came from.\n\n|Objective Three: - Prepare Escape Route\n\nThere is a disused fire escape behind the G5 building that will be useful in your escape. Prepare the ground now by attaching explosives to a blocked-up doorway. To avoid giving an alarm, you must trigger the mine once the meeting surveillance is complete.\n\n|Objective Four: - Create Vehicular Diversion\n\nAny disturbance will attract attention from the guards in the area, but this can be used to your advantage. Reprogram the autopilot guidance computer on the cab to cause it to crash nearby.\n\n|Objective Five: - Gain Entry To G5 Building\n\none of the guards by the lift entrance is in charge of a control panel that will lock the lift doors, denying access instantly. The diversion caused by the crashing cab should draw them out, leaving the way open.\n\nEND\n",
