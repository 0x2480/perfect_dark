Watch out for any guards who see you, as they're sure to try and activate it. This will alert the conspirators, who will almost certainly not go ahead with the meeting under such circumstances.

Locate it and shut it down.\n\n|Objective Two: - De-activate Laser Grid Systems\n\nAn examination of the power grid of the G5 building indicates a network of laser grids. These grids are placed specifically to deny a route into the meeting room, but if you can turn them off, the way is clear.\n\n|Objective Three: - Record Meeting\n\nThe Eye-Spy device is an excellent way to record the meeting without alerting the De Vries and the other conspirators.\n\n|Objective Four: - Retrieve Backup From Safe\n\nDr. Caroll informed Daniel of a backup personality that is stored in a safe in the G5 building. If we can obtain it it would mean that we could restore the personality to Dr. Caroll at a later date.\n\n|Objective Five: - Exit Building\n\nDestroy the blocked-up door to create your exit. If you remember which level of the fire escape is outside and you may save yourself some time.\n\nEND\n",
