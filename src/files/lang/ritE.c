The Carrington Institute response hinges on removing the President from Air Force One before Trent can do the same.\n\n|Carrington - \n\nTime is short, Joanna. In order to foil Trent's plan, you have to get the President off the plane. That means convincing him of Trent's betrayal, which in turn means getting the evidence from the baggage hold and showing it to the President.\n\n|Objective One: - Locate and Retrieve Equipment\n\nFind the equipment hidden in the baggage hold at the bottom of the aircraft and get it back. Remember that Presidential security are neutral and are not to be harmed.\n\n|Objective Two: - Locate President\n\nThe exact whereabouts of the Presidential office are not known. Once you find the office, present the evidence to the President. Make sure you get there before Trent does, or you can be sure he will manipulate the situation to his advantage.\n\n|Objective Three: - Get President to Escape Capsule\n\nThere is an emergency escape capsule on the lowest deck of the aircraft. Escort the President to the capsule, ensuring that no harm comes to him.\n\n|Objective Four: - Secure Air Force One Flight Path\n\nThe specifics of Trent's plan are not known, but it is believed that the flight crew will be in danger. Get to the cockpit and make sure of their well-being. If the worst has happened, then activate the autopilot.\n\n|Objective Five: - Detach UFO From Air Force One\n\nGet that umbilical connector off Air Force One! The quickest way to do it would be to detonate a mine in the connector itself. \n\nEND\n",
